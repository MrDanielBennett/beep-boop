#### By _**Daniel Bennett**_

## Description

_This webpage gathers a inserted number from a user and then creates an array with the length of that given input. The page will then go through that array and look for numbers containing 0, these will return with "beep" next it will search for numbers containing 1, these will return with "boop" finally if a number that is divisible by 3 appears it will return as "I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that._

### Specs
* create an array equal to input number.
* if a value contains 0 return Beep.
* if a value contains 1 return Boop.
* if a value is divisible by 3 return "I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.".
* if 1 comes before zero in a value return boop.
* if 3 comes before 1 or 0 and is divisible by 3 return "I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
